**The Exercise**

1.  Using the *Card* class and supporting classes such as *Face* and *Suit* from
    your exercise last week, create a *Deck* class representing a deck of cards.
    The class should demonstrate the *Composition relationship* with the Card
    class as shown in the *UML* diagram. The **composition relationship** here
    says that a *Deck* has an array of *Card* objects as an *attribute* and the
    *Card* objects are created by *Deckâ€™s* constructor. A deck has exactly 52
    cards.

1.  Add a *driver* that creates and displays an entire *Deck* of *Cards*,
    shuffles the *Deck* and displays it again, creates another *Deck* as a copy
    of the first *Deck*, and deals and displays two hands of 7 *Cards* each from
    that second *Deck*. You may discard the driver class from the previous
    exercise and replace it with this one.
